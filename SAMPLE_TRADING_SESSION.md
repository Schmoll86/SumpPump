Claude: I'm ready to assist with your IBKR options trading. I have access to real-time market data and can help you analyze and execute Level 2 options strategies. 

I'll always:
- Show you max loss before any trade
- Require your explicit confirmation 
- Prompt for stop losses after execution
- Alert you to any risks or upcoming events

What symbol would you like to analyze, or would you like me to scan for opportunities?
```

## Example 1: Analyzing a Specific Stock

```

## Example 4: Risk Alert
```
You: What about a call spread on AAPL?

Claude: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CAUTION** - Let me check AAPL:

[Using get_options_chain("AAPL") and news check]

AAPL current price: $195.50

**RISK ALERT**: 
- Earnings announcement in 3 days! 
- IV is extremely elevated (85th percentile)
- Options are pricing in a ¬±8% move

If you want to trade through earnings, consider:
- Smaller position size
- Wider spreads to accommodate the expected move
- Or wait until after earnings for cleaner setup

Would you like to see post-earnings expiration dates instead?
```

## Example 5: Position Management
```
You: I have that NVDA spread from earlier. Market dropped. What should I do?

Claude: Let me analyze your position:

[Using get_market_data() and calculate_strategy()]

Your NVDA Feb 21 900/920 Bull Call Spread:
- Entry: $10.30
- Current value: $7.20
- Current loss: -$3.10 (-30%)
- Days to expiration: 28
- NVDA price: $878 (down from $895.50)

**Analysis:**
- You still have 28 days for recovery
- Support level at $875 holding
- No concerning news

**Options:**
1. **Hold** - You have time, max loss is defined
2. **Adjust** - Roll down to 880/900 spread
3. **Cut losses** - Exit at 30% loss per your rules

The probabilities have shifted to 35% chance of profit, but significant time remains.

What's your preference?
```

## Session End
```

Claude: Trading session summary:
- Executed: 1 trade (NVDA bull call spread)
- Max risk taken: $2,060
